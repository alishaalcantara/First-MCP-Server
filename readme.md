My MCP server provides two tools: get_weather and read_file. The get_weather tool retrieves  real-time weather data at any given location. The read_file reads text files from a specific directory, allowing Claude to access notes, configuration files, and stored data. To install the MCP server, I had to first set up the project with the npm init -y command and then install dependencies with the npm install command. A usage example of the get_weather tool: The command get_weather ("Tampa") would return “Weather for Tampa, United States of America - Condition: Partly cloudy - Temperature: 28°C / 83°F (feels like 30°C)” A usage example of the read_file tool: The command read_file ("notes.txt") would output the contents within that file. A limitation of the read_file tool is that file access is typically restricted to one directory for security reasons. As for the get_weather tool, weather output typically depends on API availability. For the API used within this project, I have to wait 2 hours before I can use the tool again.
