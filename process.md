I built an MCP server that consists of the get_weather and read_file tools. The weather tool is integrated with the OpenWeather API to retrieve weather data in real time. The file reader tool accesses text files from a local directory and reads them. Since it is my first MCP server, I told Claude Code to keep it simple in a way that makes the workflow easy to follow.
Claude Code helped significantly during development. For example, I prompted: “Create a simple MCP server with a tool called read_file that reads the aboutme.txt file from the ‘files’ directory. Save files to ‘my-server’.,” which gave me access to a tool for clear reading of the file. Another helpful prompt was: “Create a codetour for the implementation. Reference the extension or the web.” I also prompted “Test the get_weather tool” which helped me realize the API key was misconfigured.
During debugging, my main challenge was getting the weather tool to work. I encountered errors when trying to use the free wttr.in API. To fix this issue, I transferred over to OpenWeather and used their free API key instead. Since wttr.in does not require an API key, I was having a hard time implementing it into the server. 
MCP bridges the gap between Claude and external tools. MCP servers can integrate APIs, access system files, and even perform custom configurations. If I did this again, I’d learn more about API implementation and when/how they are to be used. I’d also test my tools more than once to ensure that files won’t have to be overwritten because of incorrect API configuration.
